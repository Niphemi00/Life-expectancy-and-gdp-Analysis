## Life Expectancy & GDP Analysis by Country
    Project Overview
    This project explores the relationship between life expectancy and GDP per capita across various countries over time. The goal is to demonstrate data visualization skills using Python libraries and provide insights into how economic growth correlates with public health across the globe.

## Objectives
    -     Complete a project to add to your portfolio
    - Clean and prepare a real-world dataset.
    - Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).
    - Create compelling and informative visualizations.
    - Analyze relationships and trends across time and geography.
    - Communicate findings effectively through visual storytelling.
    - Use seaborn and Matplotlib to create visualizations

## Prerequisites
    - Data Acquisition
    - Data Visualization
    - Hypothesis Testing
    - Summarizing Quantitative Data
    - Data Wrangling and Tidying
    - Data Manipulation with Pandas

## Tools & Libraries Used
    - Python
    - Pandas – Data manipulation
    - Matplotlib – Static visualizations
    - Seaborn – Enhanced statistical plots
    - Plotly – Interactive charts
    - Jupyter Notebook – Development environment

##  Dataset Information
    File: all_data.csv
    Columns:
        Country: Name of the country
        Year: Year of record
        Life expectancy at birth (years): Average life expectancy
        GDP: Gross Domestic Product per capita

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
    Key questions explored:
    How has life expectancy changed over time?
    Is there a strong correlation between GDP and life expectancy?
    Which countries are outliers?
    Do richer countries always have better health outcomes?

## Visualizations Performed
    GDP and Life Expectancy distributions
    GDP vs Life Expectancy scatter plots (static & interactive)
    Time series line plots for trends across years
    Heatmaps of life expectancy by country and year
    Faceted plots by country and continent
    Animated bubble plots (Gapminder-style)
